# Zettelkasten
From wikipedia
	a system of note-taking and personal knowledge management used in research and study

Basically, take lots of small notes and then organize them and build meaning through association and context.

Using Obsidian to do this with hypertext linking is very powerful relative to the early days of zettelkasten done using index cards.
